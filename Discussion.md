I think the document needs:

1.  Short para to identify situation of people brought on so-called â€˜Agile'

2.  A restatement of these 2 things as hallmarks of agile:
    1.  Relationships/How we treat people
    2.  Continuous learning/Inspect and Improve

3.  Link to/restatement of the original manifesto

4.  Highlight the irony but also the pain of a so-called agile environment in which the people are powerless to change or improve. Being made powerless to improve is _exactly_ the opposite of agile
